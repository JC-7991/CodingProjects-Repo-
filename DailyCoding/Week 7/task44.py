# We can determine how "out of order" an array A is
# by counting the number of inversions it has. 
# Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] 
# but i < j. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.
# Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. 
# Do this faster than O(N^2) time.
