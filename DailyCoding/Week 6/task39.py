# Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized 
# with a starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of 
# steps it should run for. Once initialized, it should print out 
# the board state at each step. Since it's an infinite board, print 
# out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the top-leftmost 
# live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.
